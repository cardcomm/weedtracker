        <h2>Welcome to WeedTracker Support</h2>
        <p>This site provides information about the WeedTracker app, including documentation, support, and our privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <p>WeedTracker is your personal inventory and usage tracker for medical or recreational cannabis. Whether you’re staying organized, monitoring usage patterns, or keeping tabs on your favorite strains, WeedTracker gives you the tools to do it all — privately and on your terms.</p>

        <p>Track your inventory and consumption history with ease. You can log every addition and removal from your inventory, view detailed usage over time, and set customizable low stock warnings to stay ahead of what you need. You can even attach images to any item for quick visual reference — or keep things minimal with text-only records if you prefer.</p>

        <p>WeedTracker is fully customizable. Personalize product tiers to match your favorite dispensary’s categories, and define your own strain types to fit your needs. Searching and filtering is fast and flexible, whether you’re browsing your current stash or reviewing your full usage history.</p>

        <p>Export your inventory and transaction history anytime using standard text and CSV formats — no proprietary lock-in. You can import your saved data, making backups and manual management simple and reliable.</p>

        <p>Your data stays in sync across all your Apple devices with built-in iCloud support. WeedTracker works beautifully on both iPhone and iPad, and is also compatible with Mac through Made for iPad.</p>
