			<p>Welcome to WeedTracker! This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up your inventory. As you add, adjust, or remove items, the app automatically builds a complete history of your usage — no extra steps required.</p>
			
			<h4>1. Add Your First Strain</h4>
			<p>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to add a new item to your inventory. You can give it a name (e.g., “Blue Dream”), and enter the cost and quantity. Optionally, you can assign a tier (like “Premium” or “Budget”), select a type (e.g., Flower, Concentrate, Edible), and even attach an image for quick visual reference.</p>
			
			<h4>2. Customize Tier Levels and Types (Optional)</h4>
			<p>WeedTracker lets you define your own tiers and item types to match the categories used by your local dispensaries. These can be managed from the Settings screen, and any changes will apply automatically across your inventory.</p>
			
			<h4>3. Inventory Adjustments Are Automatically Tracked</h4>
			<p>Whenever you create a new strain, restock an item, use something from your inventory, or delete a strain entirely, WeedTracker automatically logs the change as a transaction. These transaction records form your usage history — no need to manually log anything.</p>			
			<p>You can view each transaction's details, including the date, amount changed, new totals, and any notes you added. This helps you keep an accurate history of your habits and inventory movement over time. You can access your usage history from the App main menu.</p>
			
			<h4>4. View Usage History</h4>
			<p>Choose <strong>View History</strong> from the main menu to see a log of all your automatically recorded transactions. You can filter the list by transaction type, date range, or keyword match across strain names and notes, making it easy to find what you're looking for.</p>
			<p>The history view gives you a clear, scrollable record of all changes to your inventory, including the date, action taken, quantity adjusted, and any notes entered at the time.</p>
			
			<h4>5. Set Low Stock Warnings</h4>
			<p>You can set a low stock warning threshold from the <strong>App Options</strong> screen, available in the main menu. Once enabled, WeedTracker will alert you when your total inventory level drops below that quantity.</p>
			<p>This helps you stay on top of your supply without the need to constantly check levels manually — a simple way to avoid running out unexpectedly.</p>			
			
			<h4>6. iCloud Sync & Backups</h4>
			<p>Your data is stored privately on your device and can sync across all your Apple devices using iCloud (if enabled). You can also export your data as text or CSV files and import it later, ensuring you always have access to your records.</p>
