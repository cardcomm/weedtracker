	<!-- BEGIN GETTING STARTED -->
		<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

			<p>Welcome to WeedTracker! This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up your inventory. As you add, adjust, or remove items, the app automatically builds a complete history of your usage — no extra steps required.</p>
			
			<h4>1. Add Your First Strain</h4>
			<p>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to add a new item to your inventory. You can give it a name (e.g., “Blue Dream”), and enter the cost and quantity. Optionally, you can assign a tier (like “Premium” or “Budget”), select a type (e.g., Flower, Concentrate, Edible), and even attach an image for quick visual reference.</p>
			
			<h4>2. Customize Tier Levels and Types (Optional)</h4>
			<p>WeedTracker lets you define your own tiers and item types to match the categories used by your local dispensaries. These can be managed from the Settings screen, and any changes will apply automatically across your inventory.</p>
			
			<h4>3. Inventory Adjustments Are Automatically Tracked</h4>
			<p>Whenever you create a new strain, restock an item, use something from your inventory, or delete a strain entirely, WeedTracker automatically logs the change as a transaction. These transaction records form your usage history — no need to manually log anything.</p>			
			<p>You can view each transaction's details, including the date, amount changed, new totals, and any notes you added. This helps you keep an accurate history of your habits and inventory movement over time. You can access your usage history from the App main menu.</p>
			
			<h4>4. View Usage History</h4>
			<p>Choose <strong>View History</strong> from the main menu to see a log of all your automatically recorded transactions. You can filter the list by transaction type, date range, or keyword match across strain names and notes, making it easy to find what you're looking for.</p>
			<p>The history view gives you a clear, scrollable record of all changes to your inventory, including the date, action taken, quantity adjusted, and any notes entered at the time.</p>
			
			<h4>5. Set Low Stock Warnings</h4>
			<p>You can set a low stock warning threshold from the <strong>App Options</strong> screen, available in the main menu. Once enabled, WeedTracker will alert you when your total inventory level drops below that quantity.</p>
			<p>This helps you stay on top of your supply without the need to constantly check levels manually — a simple way to avoid running out unexpectedly.</p>			
			
			<h4>6. iCloud Sync & Backups</h4>
			<p>Your data is stored privately on your device and can sync across all your Apple devices using iCloud (if enabled). You can also export your data as text or CSV files and import it later, ensuring you always have access to your records.</p>
			
			<h4>See the screen shots below for an overview of the main inventory functionality.</h4>

        <h3 id="adding-strains">Adding and Managing Inventory</h3>

			<p>To add a new item to your inventory, tap the <strong>+</strong> button. A form will appear where you can enter details like the strain name, quantity, cost, product type (such as Flower or Concentrate), and tier (e.g., Premium, Budget). You can also attach an image if you’d like a quick visual reference.</p>
			
			<p>To update an existing item, simply select it from the list. From the detail view, you can:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Tap <strong>Add</strong> to increase the quantity</li>
			  <li>Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to decrease it (e.g., for usage or disposal)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To delete an item, either:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the list view to reveal delete options, or</li>
			  <li>Swipe the item to the left and tap <strong>Delete</strong> — this uses standard iOS swipe-to-delete behavior</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Each of these actions automatically creates a transaction history entry, so your usage is always tracked in the background.</p>
			
			<p>All changes are saved automatically — there’s no need to press a Save button.</p>
			
			<p>When adding or removing stock in common increments, you may use the built-in fraction picker to quickly select standard ounce-based amounts like 1/8, 1/4, or 1 oz. WeedTracker will automatically convert these to grams.</p>

	<!-- BEGIN Searching and Filtering -->	
	
	 <h3 id="logging-usage">Searching and Sorting</h3>	
		
		<p>WeedTracker includes flexible filtering and sorting tools to help you quickly find what you need. These tools work consistently across the app, though the available filter options vary depending on the view.</p>
		
		<p>You can filter your data by a variety of fields — such as name, quantity, type, tier, cost, or rating — depending on the context. For numeric fields like quantity and cost, you can choose a comparison (greater than, less than, equal to) to help narrow results. For tier and type fields, you can select multiple values using the “Add” button.</p>
		
		<p>You can also enter freeform text to search by name or notes, and filter by date range (in the View History and Export History views).</p>
		
		<p>Once filters are applied, only matching results will be shown. You’ll also see a compact summary of the filters currently in effect. You can temporarily hide or show the filtered list using a toggle, or clear all filters at once to reset the view.</p>
		
		<p>Sorting lets you reorder the results by name. You can toggle ascending or descending order with a tap.</p>
		
		<p>These tools are available in the following places:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Inventory view</strong> – filter and sort your current items</li>
		  <li><strong>View History</strong> – filter and sort past transactions</li>
		  <li><strong>Export History</strong> – filter and sort which transactions to export</li>
		  <li><strong>Export Inventory</strong> – always exports your full inventory; filtering and sorting are not applicable</li>
		</ul>
